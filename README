TIMETRACKER USERS - PAY ATTENTION. This message is important to you. You may lose data if you fail to heed this message.
Jedi TimeTracker is v2.1 of Ray Camden's TimeTracker application. If you wish to use this instead of TimeTracker, you can 
import your data. Please follow the documentation on the GitHub Wiki.

v2.1 is a near total rewrite of TimeTracker. JTT now uses Swiz, and the presentation model and command patterns. 
It also leverages airORM, although this is a fork of the original library with a number of fixes. My fork can 
be found at 

		https://github.com/tjdownes/airorm. 

All support is provided through the project GitHub site at 

		https://github.com/tjdownes/Jedi-TimeTracker.

Credit for the original code goes to Raymond Camden who initially authored the TimeTracker
application. This application was converted using Ray's code, which can be found at
